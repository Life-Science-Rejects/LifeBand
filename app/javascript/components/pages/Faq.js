        <p>Avoid Redundancy:</p>
        <p>
        Every doctor’s visit, every trip to the ER, there are many questions that are asked. However, there are some questions that are always asked: “What are your current daily medications? What’s your medical history? Any chronic medical conditions?”
        </p>
        <p>
        These are asked so that medical professionals can adapt their care to be specific to YOUR needs. This form answers them for you so you don’t have to worry about remembering every detail for every visit.
