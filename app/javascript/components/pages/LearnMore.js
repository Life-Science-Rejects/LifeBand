        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>
        Any individual who has their ailments knows their own condition better than anyone else. However, because of this, many feel they no longer can trust leaving the area in which they reside in for fear of needing medical attention from professionals who do not know them or their needs…

        <h4>What is LifeBand?</h4>
        <p>
        LifeBand is a simple, but life changing tool that we have developed to help give each individual the opportunity to take their life back from their ailments. We, here, at LifeScience Rejects understand that every person is unique in their medical needs, and it must be communicated, no matter what! When you create an account with LifeBand, you are simply filling out a form giving all important information that YOU as the patient would like to be known.

        <h4>List of Emergency Contacts:</h4>
        <p>
        Let’s face it; we ALL need to be prepared for any emergency. Having a list of Emergency Contacts is one of the best ways we can be prepared for any scenario; especially for scenarios where we need others to speak for us! In this case, we would do well in having loved ones at the ready who know us personally, and LifeBand allows you to have that list all in one place.
        </p>
        <h4>List of Current Daily Medications:</h4>
        <p>
        Every visit to the ER requires the medical staff to know exactly what medications you are currently taking every single day. Why not keep a list of this as well?
